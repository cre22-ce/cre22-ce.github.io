<h1>Artifacts and Research:</h1>
<p style="font-size: 150%;"><b>1.</b> A Program</p>
<p>My first artifact is a program that I have written that encodes and decodes Portable Network Graphic (png) files. There are 2 files associated with this: <code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>lib.rs</code>. Each file is explained below. This is an example of pure code that a Computer Engineer would have to write.<br />
<br />This code is written in a language called Rust, a memory safe, high performance programming language.
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="hover(event, &quot;A <b>memory safe</b> program is a program that properly allocates and deallocates memory without explicit code from the programmer.<br />A <b>high performance language</b> gives a programmer more control on how their program compiles and runs on a computer.&quot;)" onmouseleave="unhover()"><b>?</b></a>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 125%;"><b>1.1</b> <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<p>This <b>manifest</b> file tells the compiler (the program that turns human readable code into instructions for the processor) information about the binary (the executable file generated by the compiler; a.k.a application, program) and the required dependencies (external bundles of code used in this program; a.k.a libraries, packages, crates <a href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="hover(event, &quot;\&quot;Crates\&quot; are specific to Rust.&quot;,{width: &quot;10em&quot;})" onmouseleave="unhover()">!!</a>) that need to be included.</p>

<iframe src="./files/png.Cargo.toml.html" class="code rust" style="height: 10em; display: block;"></iframe>
<p>
This specific file is telling the compiler that:
<ol>
    <li>The package name is <code>"png"</code></li>
    <li>This is version <code>"0.1.0"</code></li>
    <li>The list of authors are <code>["Caleb Eastman"]</code> (only one author in this list)</li>
    <li>The edition of this program is <code>"2018"</code></li>
    <li>This program uses the <code>flate2</code> library</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br />
<p style="font-size: 125%;"><b>1.2</b> <code>lib.rs</code>:</p>
<p>This <b>source file</b> contains all the code specific to this application. At the top of the file (though it can be anywhere), the libraries that were listed in <code>Cargo.toml</code> are imported into the scope (a collection of variables and functions that can be accessed) of this program. The <code>std</code> library means "standard" and is included in the compiler so it doesn't need to be listed separately but needs to be requested explicitly here to use it. The text after the <code>::</code> indicates that the program only uses that specific part of the library instead of the whole thing, cutting down on binary size and unused code in the end.</p>
<p>This code was in the middle of a complete rewrite when I stopped working on it so I'm not even sure this works properly. Luckily, this shows how a Computer Engineer might organize their workflow in the middle of a project. Lines that start with <code style="color: green">//</code> or are surrounded by <code style="color: green">/* ... */</code> are comments that are ignored by the compiler. Comments serve as an easy way for programmers to communicate with other programmers who might use their code or as a way to communicate with themselves in the future. Most of the comments in this file are notes to myself on what a particular line of code does or, if a line starts with <code style="color: green">//<code style="background-color: yellow; border-radius: 7px; font-size: 100%;">TODO:</code></code> ("TODO:" gets highlighted in my text editor so it stands out), it would tell me what my next step in development should be.

<p style="font-size: 150%;"><b>2.</b> Documentation</p>
<p>My second artifact is a documented file. While it may seem like just another source file, this has some special comment lines in it. Before I said that any line that started with <code style="color: green">//</code> was a comment, but there is a special case for lines that start with <code style="color: blue">///</code>.<br />This is called a <b>documentation</b> line and provides both the integrated development environment (IDE)
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onmouseover="hover(event, &quot;An <b>IDE</b> is an advanced program that assists programmers in writing code. It is an integrated because it provides advanced tools and data about the application being written and is an environment because it can utilize all of the files in a codebase rather than just one at a time.&quot;,{width: &quot;25em&quot;})" onmouseleave="unhover()">?</a>
and the programmer with some critical information. Documentation lines are basically mini technical write-ups about the function and use of individual lines of code. They are placed above the lines they intend to document. These lines are important for the next part of this artifact.</p>
<p>This specific code is a utility that parses binary HTTP Responses and HTTP Requests. The data is stored in objects that can be mutated that can then be turned back into binary to send through an HTTP socket.</p>
<p><i>Note: I omitted the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file for this artifact as it is more of the same; The libraries included are <code>regex</code> and <code>lazy_static</code>.</i></p>
<p style="font-size: 125%;"><b>1.1</b> <code>lib.rs</code>:</p>
<iframe src="./files/http.lib.rs.html" class="code rust" style="height: 18em; display: block;"></iframe>
<p>Now that all of those documentation lines are in place, we can extract them into a handy local webpage for future reference. This part of the process is made easy by the Rust compiler as it just one command, but methods to extract inline documentation (documentation that is integrated with source code) vary between programming languages</p>
<p>This is more evident of what a Computer Engineer who specializes in Rust might present as a product to employers and coworkers.</p>
<p style="font-size: 125%;"><b>1.2</b> <code>Doc files</code>:</p>
<p>This is an interactive webpane. Follow the links to navigate the documentation. The Rust compiler generated the styling for this documentation, but it is populated with the text I provided through the documentation lines.</p>
